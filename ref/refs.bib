We find that successful social search is conducted primarily through intermediate to weak strength ties, does not require highly connected {\textquotedblleft}hubs{\textquotedblright} to succeed, and, in contrast to unsuccessful social search, disproportionately relies on professional relationships. By accounting for the attrition of message chains, we estimate that social searches can reach their targets in a median of five to seven steps, depending on the separation of source and target, although small variations in chain lengths and participation rates generate large differences in target reachability. We conclude that although global social networks are, in principle, searchable, actual success depends sensitively on individual incentives.},

  abstract = "Recommender Systems deal with the issue of overloading information by retrieving the most relevant sources in the wide range of web services. They help users by predicting their interests in many domains like e-government, social networks, e-commerce and entertainment. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most promising technique used in recommender systems to give suggestions based on liked-mind users’ preferences. Despite the widespread use of CF in providing personalized recommendation, this technique has problems including cold start, data sparsity and gray sheep. Eventually, these problems lead to the deterioration of the efficiency of CF. Most existing recommendation methods have been proposed to overcome the problems of CF. However, they fail to suggest the top-n recommendations based on the sequencing of the users’ priorities. In this research, to overcome the shortcomings of CF and current recommendation methods in ranking preference dataset, we have used a new graph-based structure to model the users’ priorities and capture the association between users and items. Users’ profiles are created based on their past and current interest. This is done because their interest can change with time. Our proposed algorithm keeps the preferred items of active user at the beginning of the recommendation list. This means these items come under top-n recommendations, which results in satisfaction among users. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm archives the significant improvement in comparison with CF and other proposed recommendation methods in terms of recall, precision, f-measure and MAP metrics using two benchmark datasets including MovieLens and Superstore."

  abstract={Most networks, such as those generated from social media, tend to evolve gradually with frequent changes in the activity and the interactions of their participants. Furthermore, the communities inside the network can grow, shrink, merge, or split, and the entities can move from one community to another. The aim of community detection methods is precisely to detect the evolution of these communities. However, evaluating these algorithms requires tests on real or artificial networks with verifiable ground truth. Dynamic networks generators have been recently proposed for this task, but most of them consider only the structure of the network, disregarding the characteristics of the nodes. In this paper, we propose a new generator for dynamic attributed networks with community structure that follow the properties of real-world networks. The evolution of the network is performed using two kinds of operations: Micro-operations are applied on the edges and vertices, while macro-operations on the communities. Moreover, the properties of real-world networks such as preferential attachment or homophily are preserved during the evolution of the network, as confirmed by our experiments.},
